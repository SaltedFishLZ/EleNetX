How To Obtain Benchmark Data

1.0 Introduction

All of the primary benchmark data is contained on the IBM
PC-compatible floppy.  If you cannot read the floppy or want
all of the data, read on.

The full set of benchmark data is available in PARCVAX at
Xerox PARC in the directory /user/ftp/pdworkshop.
PARCVAX is running BSD 4.3 UNIX. You may obtain the
information through ther ARPA Net FTP (File Transfer
Protocol) or by calling PARCVAX and retrieving the
information.  If both of these methods are unsatisfactory,
please call, write or send an electronic message to Ken Roberts
or Bryan Preas.  We will assist you in obtaining the
benchmark data by electronic mail or 9-track tape.

**** WARNING ****

Do NOT use the PARCVAX for any purpose other than
retrieving the benchmark information for the Physical Design
Workshop from the directory /user/ftp/pdworkshop/.  Xerox
has been kind enough to allow you to use PARCVAX for this
purpose.  Don't abuse the privilege. ANY unauthorized use of
this machine will result in the access being denied and the
data removed from the machine!

2.0 ARPA Net FTP

If you have access to an ARPA Net connection you may
establish an FTP connection to host parcvax.Xerox.COM; use
the account pdworksh and password bpreas.  You should
retrieve the file in the directory /user/ftp/psworkshop. 

3.0 Telephone Call to PARCVAX

You may dial the PARCVAX triple modem (# (415) 858-2605,
7 data bits, even parity, 1 stop bit) and retrieve the
information.  Instructions for ASCII transfer (if you can get a
reliable phone line) Kermit, and XModem transfer are given
below.

3.1 XModem

Disable Cyclic Redundancy Check on your Xmodem. I cannot
get the batch transfer protocol to work on this port.  The
typescript below demonstrates the use of single file transfers.

(return to your machine an issue command to retrieve index.txt)

(retrieve the other files in the same way)

parcvax.xerox.com> logout


3.2 Kermit Protocol

In order to get Kermit to work on this port you must use 8
data bits, no parity an filter out the parity bit for text transfer
(using Crosstalk INfilter, for example).  A script of the
terminal session is shown below.

Type ? for help

C-Kermit>server

C-Kermit server starting.  Return to your local machine by
typing its escape sequence for closing the connection, and
issue further commands from there.  To shut down the C-
Kermit server, issue the FINISH or BYE command and then
reconnect.
# N3

(return control to your machine and get *.*)
(issue finish to terminate the server on PARCVAX)
(return control to PARCVAX and logout)

C-Kermit server done
C-Kermit>quit

3.3 ASCII Capture

You may use unchecked ASCII to retrieve the benchmark
data.  This method is recommended only to obtain the initial
information necessary to get you started.  A typescript
follows; Parentheses set off my comments to you.

4.0 9-Track Tape

We are prepared to send you a 9-track tape.  Call or send a
message with your requirements.  You are requested to return
the tape.

5.0 Electronic Mail

We are prepared to send electronic mail but the files will
have to divided and sent over time.  Send your electronic
mail address.
