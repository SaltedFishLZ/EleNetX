This directory contains a translator from YAL to VPNR.  The usage is

	yal2vpnr < yal_file > vpnr_file scaling_factor

All dimensions in the yal_file are multplied by the scaling factor.
The default scaling factor is 1000; this will produce vpnr files with
all dimensions specified in nanometers.

The parser will read both the 1987 and 1988 variants of YAL.

There are some comments in the source code.  If anything is not clear,
please send me mail or call.
