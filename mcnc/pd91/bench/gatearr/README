This directory contains the library that should be used with the data
in the files 'primary1' and 'primary2' from the 'stdcell' directory.
The specifications of the gate arrays to be used for these circuts can
be found in the comments in the 'primary1.yal' and 'primary2.yal'
files.

In addition, the 'industry2' and 'industry3' benchmarks can be used as
a gate array benchmark as well.  Please assume identical library of
cell outlines as for the standard cells.  The additional information
for gate-array placement/routing is as follows

========= industry2.gate.array ==========

The data below is expressed in the grid units of 4 microns:

As a gate array, the circuit has 66 rows, each of whose length is
4000.  Each cell must begin on an even grid (i.e. 0,2,4,...). There are
16 routing tracks available in each channel (for a total of 1072
(16X67)). Thus, the row separation is (accounting for the track pitch
of 2 units): (16+1)X2 = 34 units.

========= industry3.gate.array ==========

The data below is expressed in the grid units of 4 microns:

The gate array version of this circuit has 51 rows, and therefore 52
channels, each of which has 38 tracks available for routing. The length
of each row is 7300 units, so the total row length is 372,300.  The
routing pitch is 2 units in each direction. One can then deduce that
the core area is 7300 by 7320.
