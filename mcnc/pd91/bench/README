This directory contains the benchmark data for the Physical
Design Workshop number II, of 1991, to be held at Nemecolin Woodlands, 
Laurel Highlands, Pennsylvania - 412 329-6190

The benchmark set is basically taken from the 1989 and 1990 workshops.
Most of the work of assembing the software, and all the standard
cell and floorplanning system, was done by Krzysztof Kozminski, whose
address is listed below. 

IMPORTANT: There will undoubtedly be changes/fixes to the benchamrks.
Please check back after April 1, 1991, and look for a file named
Announcements in this directory. 

Comments about the selection of the benchmarks, especially the
cell synthesis ones, can be directed to me, 

Dwight Hill,

(908) 582-7766

Please send me your e-mail address when you pick up the benchmarks.

Questions about VPNR should be directed to Krzysztof Kozminski,
whose address is below. Kris supplied all of the software,
scripts and many of the benchmarks themselves.

The rest of this file is taken from the IWLS90 file.

Note on languages:

The benchmarks are described in two languages: YAL and VPNR.  Most of
the benchmarks have two representations, one in YAL and another in
VPNR; these representations are supposed to be equivalent.  Several
benchmarks are described only in VPNR.  I expect to have a VPNR->YAL
translator finshed within a week or so, and will add the equivalent
VPNR representations as well as double-check the YAL-VPNR equivalence.
Meanwhile, please treat the benchmark data as preliminary, although any
changes will be minor.

In order to ease the burden of entering the benchmarks into your
system, parsers for both YAL and VPNR are provided.  I have also
enclosed a translator that was used to obtain VPNR data from YAL.

The source for the VPNR software is located in ./vpnr, and the
executables will be located (after they have been made) in ./bin.  The
software included is really just a parser and related functions.  It is
intended that each group would modify the software to interface with
its own system.  In order to use it, you will need to parse the vpnr
files and write out the information you need in the language your
system accepts, or perhaps link the parser with your system.  For more
details, see the files in the 'vpnr' directory and comments in db.vpnr.

For participants in the 'flexibility' benchmark:

A description of MOSIS SCMOS technology is contained in the `tech'
directory.  This directory also contains a technology normalization
cell.  If you use rules other than MOSIS SCMOS, please complete the
technology normalization cell.  This is a simple cell that you should
construct by hand, not synthesize.  It is not, strictly speaking, one
of the benchmarks.  Rather, it is intended to normalize the differences
in the design rules that various participants will be using.  Enter it
exactly as described in the tech directory, compact it (if you use
compactors), and make a plot of it, showing the X and Y dimensions in
microns.  Plotting instructions are in tech/README.  At the workshop,
participants who did not use the MOSIS rules will have their results
scaled according to the ratio of their dimensions to the MOSIS design's
dimensions.
