This directory contains data for the mixed macro-block / standard cell
benchmarks.  The four mixed examples from the Physical Design Workshop '87
and Workshop on Placement and Routing '88 have been dropped and replaced
with the following industrial examples, originally obtained in YAL format:

NOTES:

Unless specified otherwise, all signal ports in all cells are on
METAL2 layer, and all power/ground ports are on METAL1.

CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INFORMATION:

All ports of a block that have the same name are connected within the
block and there is no need to connect them outside of the block.
Signal pins are always internally connected, and may be used to feed
through the blocks.  However, some of the power/ground terminals do
have to be connected externally.  For example, if there are 6 VDD
terminals  with names VDD0, VDD1, and VDD2, only one of each name must
be connected - so at least 3 connections must be made.

For STANDARD cells, assume that all ports that have the same name are
connected inside the cell.

All GND/VDD connections are IMPLICIT and no references to
them are made in the NELIST section (this is unlike in the macro-cell
benchmark, where power supply nets are listed explicitly).  Please
be sure to connect the P/G nets nevertheless!

In the YAL files:
-----------------
Pass-thru terminals have been automatically inserted by an
over-cell router. These terminals will not line up with the cell
boundary.

Standard cell terminals are really in the center of the cell
to permit metal 2 stub connections to be made over the cell.

In the VPNR files:
------------------
All terminals are moved to the nearest side of the cell boundary,
both in the standard cells and building blocks.

Additional requests:
====================

P/G nets constraints:
	Only the electromigration phenomenon is accounted for.  Assume that
	the P/G port widths specified in the data are proportional to the
	expected currents and proceed from there.

Aspect ratio constraints:
	Try to produce the following aspect ratios for each benchmark circuit:
	1, 1.5, and 2.

Fixed widths:
	MIX1: 2500
	MIX2: 3500
	MIX3: 5000

Critical nets:
	Not specified.
