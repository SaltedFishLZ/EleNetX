Guidelines for Reporting Results
================================

All routing should be done in two layers, unless specified otherwise.

Placement and Routing Procedures
================================

We realize that it is difficult to fulfill all the requirements
specified for the examples, especially if your system is currently
being developed. Thus we propose several levels of participation.

Everybody who participates on level 2 or higher, is also asked to
participate on level_1, so as to have a common denominator for
all participants.

level_1:
	Treat P/G nets as signal nets.
	For building blocks and standard cells: Place the blocks and route
	all nets such that your layout fits into the least-area rectangle.
	For gate arrays and sea-of-gates: Place the cells in the least-area
	rectangle that has the aspect ratio specified for the initial GA
	configuration and enables your system to route all nets.

level_2a:
	level_1 with P/G nets having proper wire widths such that electro-
	migration constraints are fulfilled and, if possible, voltage drops
	as well.

level_2b:
	level_1 + nets designated as critical satisfy their constraints.

level_3:
	level_2a + nets designated as critical satisfy their constraints.
	
From now on, all levels of participation are relevant only for building
blocks, standard cell, and mixed building block/standard cell examples.

level_4a:
	level_1 + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

level_4b:
	level_1 + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

level_5a:
	level_2a + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

level_5b:
	level_2b + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

level_5c:
	level_2a + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

level_5d:
	level_2b + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

level_6a:
	level_3 + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

level_6b:
	level_3 + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

In addition to the specified above levels 1-6, you are invited to do the
same problems using 3 layers of metal.  Layer 3 can route anywhere, but
vias to METAL3 are not allowed over the area of any cell or block.  The
corresponding levels will be called level_1(3M), level_2a(3M), etc.

Submission of the results
=========================

For the benchmarks results supplied to MCNC in machine-readable form,
an effort will be made to plot them on a color Versatec. The plots will
then be made available to the participants.

Participants are asked to deposit a compressed tar archive with the
results of the placement and routing examples on the MCNCUs ftp server
machine in the directory pub/benchmark/laysynth90/results, and then
immediately send mail to kk@mcnc.org with a notification of the
transfer, so that your file can be copied to a safe place and the space
on the ftp server released. Alternately, you may send a magnetic tape
in tar format. The layouts should be submitted in CIF or Magic formats.

Please submit your results before May 1, 1990 to assure the availability
of the plots.

Presentation at the Workshop
============================

Participants will be asked to spend a few minutes presenting their
results at the Workshop during a 1.5-hour long session.  The exact time
available for the presentation will depend on the number of
participants; please count on about 5-10 minutes per presentation.

The presentation should include a brief overview of the placement and
routing methods. Also, we ask you to show us a picture of your result
for those levels on which you choose to participate.  If you wish to
prepare the picture yourself, please use the magnification as specified
for each benchmark in the appropriate README file.

We are interested in how you routed P/G nets, what were your
considerations for choosing the topology and determining wire widths.
For building blocks examples, please show us also the results of
placement, before routing has been completed. All other comments and
suggestions are welcome.

Please keep track of the human and machine  time  spent  on  each
benchmark.   If  your  CAD  tool  is interactive, count all time spent
interacting with it.  Show these times for each benchmark.  Let us know
the number of program runs done for each benchmark and whether you did
any 'tuning' of your software to obtain the best performance.

Please run your local design rule checker on each  of  your  layouts.
If  you  have  software that can extract and compare netlists, please
do so also.  In the case of the flexibility  benchmark,  which is an
8 bit accumulator, you may want to simulate it to see if it actually
accumulates.  In  any  case,  please  state what checks you made.

Quality Criteria
================

Main criterion:
-------------

Core area size in square microns.

Auxiliary figures of merit:
---------------------------

For gate arrays: number of unconnected net segments (from-to pairs)
in the initially specified array.

Summation of total wire lengths on each layer in microns.

Lengths of critical nets in microns.

Total number of vias.

Area occupied by P/G in square microns.
