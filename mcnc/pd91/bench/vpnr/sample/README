This directory contains a simple example of using 'load' to read some info
from the cell database.  The code is meant to be readable, with no emphasis
whatsoever on the optimality, diagnostics, foolproofness, and such.

The resulting program will read transistor lists from a database and will
print it out in a neat readable form.
