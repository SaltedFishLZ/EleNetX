There are three software subdirectories here:

	parser - contains the parser  library
	load   - contains the load utility and templates for the functions
	         called by the parser
	sample - example of using 'load'. Use it with 'sampledata' as
		 standard input.

Several directories will be created by 'make install':

	include - contains vparser.h, to be used by all customized parsers.
	../bin	- contains 'load' executable shell
	lib	- contains 'load' filter and some useful files.

In order to install the programs, edit the Makefile in this directory
and change DESTDIR to be the directory where bin/, include/, and lib/
subdirectories should reside (I use my home directory for DESTDIR).
Then do
	make makefiles
	make install

And that's it.

My Makefiles are rather complicated but they can be used do do a lot of
things.  They are rather extensively commented.  In short, here is
how to, e.g., add a source file to be compiled with a program:

1) Add the name of the file to the SOURCES definition
2) Add the object file name to the specific instructions between the
   lines containing the word SPECIFIC.

In case of doubt, please call me or mail.

NOTE: there is a file called ".preinstall" in this directory. DO NOT REMOVE
      this file or 'make' will fail.  If you move the contents of this
      directory elsewhere, remember to more .preinstall as well.  Files
      named ".preinstall.*', where '*' stands for a string of digits,
      can be removed, though.  They result from aborted 'make' runs.
      After the move, edit the Makefile as above (if in th new location
      you have other subdirectories to execute 'make' in, add them to
      the SUBDIR definition in this Makefile), and repeaat the
      installation.
