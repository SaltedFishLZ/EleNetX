Notes:

See *.tech for P/G constants.

BBL1: This benchmark was used in the Physical Design Workshop 1989.  Plot
      magnification: 40

BBL2: This benchmark was used in the Physical Design Workshop 1989.  Plot
      magnification: 100

BBL3: 8 large blocks and one small - a test for an extreme mismatch of block
      sizes.  Plot magnification: 40

BBL4: Relatively uniform distribution of block size from 0.18 M sq.microns
      to 1M sq.microns + a couple of larger blocks.  Aspect ratios distributed
      uniformly from 1.7 to 3.2. Plot magnification: 40

BBL5: Large variations in block sizes and aspect ratios.  Plot magnification:
      100.

Unless specified otherwise, all signal ports in all cells are on
METAL2 layer, and all power/ground ports are on METAL1.

====================

P/G nets constraints:
	Specified in xerox.tech and ami.tech.  Your program should adjust
	the width of the P/G ports on each cell while preserving the center
	of the minimum-size port specified in each block.  The same should be
	done for other ports which have the width initially set to 1 micron
	(in most cases, use minimum allowed widths).

Aspect ratio constraints:
	Try to produce the following aspect ratios for each benchmark circuit:
	1, 1.5, and 2.

Fixed widths:
	BBL1: 4500
	BBL4: 5000
	BBL5: 2300
	BBL2 and BBL3 - not specified.

Critical nets:
	Specified only in BBL1
