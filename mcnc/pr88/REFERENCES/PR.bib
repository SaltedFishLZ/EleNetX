%X The active area percentage and the CPU time on a VAX8650 for PrimGA1 and 
PrimGA2 benchmarks are reported.  
The total net length for PrimGA2 is compared against that of other systems 
e.g. LTX2, GE, Proud.
The system uses a min-cut floorplanner, an exhaustive enumeration local 
placer and an area router with rip-up-and-reroute algorithm.

%X This paper gives the total wire length and the chip area for PrimBBL1 
benchmark.  (Post-layout result is also shown.)  The authors map the placement 
problem (with rectangular and L-shaped blocks) into a nonlinear and nonconvex 
programming problem and use a modified penalty method to solve the problem.  
Pin positions on the blocks are also optimized.

%X This paper reports half-perimeter and minimum spanning tree wire lengths for 
PrimGA1 and PrimGA2 benchmarks.  Maximum horizontal and vertical
congestions and CPU times are presented as well.  A pseudo Steiner tree
model for the net-points, which selects the gate positions to best
minimize the wiring congestion, along with a virtual snap-to-grid procedure
, which places the gates in rows to best alleviate the wiring congestion of
the channels, are used.

%X A new global router for standard cell layouts is presented. The algorithm
processes all nets in parallel.  Initially, it finds an optimal spanning 
forest on a net connection graph that contains all the 
interconnection information for pins in the design.  The number and
the locations of all feedthroughs added to rows are thus determined. 
In the next stage, the net segments - to complete connections for each net - are 
chosen such that the total channel density is minimized.  
Results on chip width and chip height, total number of tracks and
total feedthrough count for PrimSC1 and PrimSC2 are reported and compared
with those obtained by TimberWolfSC version 4.2 global router.

%X A new global router for row-based layout styles such as sea-of-gates, 
gate array, and standard cell circuits is presented. 
The algorithm finds an approximate Steiner tree for each net and then converts
all nonvertical and nonhorizontal edges in the tree to L-shaped segments. 
A coarse global routing step determines the orientations of switchable 
L-shaped segments (in order to minimize the total channel density).
Next, specific feedthrough paths are assigned.
Effort is made to minimize the horizontal spans of segments and to perfectly
align the feedthroughs.
Results on number of tracks and CPU time (on SUN3/260) for PrimSC1, PrimSC2,
PrimGA1 and PrimGA2 are reported and compared with TimberWolfSC version 4.2 global
router.

%X A hierarchical placement algorithm for building block layout is presented.
The algorithm combines the bottom-up shape propagation and the
top-down enumeration techniques in order to minimize a linear combination
of chip area, total wire length and aspect ratio mismatch.  
Other features of the system include hierarchical wiring area estimation 
(during placement) and shape optimization (after placement).
Chip area, wire length, and total via count for PrimBBL1 and PrimBBL2
benchmarks are reported and compared with those of MOSAICO, VITAL, Seatle
Silicon, and Delft University.

%X A new placement method for cell-based layout styles is presented. 
It is composed of alternating and interacting global optimization and 
partitioning phases. In the global optimization phase, a constrained quadratic
optimization problem is solved to determine the global placement of cells.
In the partitioning phase, each region is divided into two subregions, 
subsets of cells are assigned to these subregions, and
new geometric constraints on cells are generated.
Total half perimeter lengths and minimum spanning trees with squared Euclidean 
metric lengths for PrimSC1 and PrimSC2 are reported.  The total
half perimeter length, chip area, and CPU time for PrimBBL2 are given as well.

net length, number of vias, and CPU times (on Apollo DN3000) are reported
