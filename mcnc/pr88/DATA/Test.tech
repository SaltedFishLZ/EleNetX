The following design rules apply to circuits Test01 - Test 08.

  Metal width - 8 microns
  Metal spacing - 8 microns
  Poly width - 4 microns
  Poly spacing - 4 microns
  Contact size - 4X4 microns
  
  Horizontally, vertically and diagonally adjacent contacts are
    allowed.

  Standard cells may be reflected about the Y axis.

  Pad cells should be rotated so that the bonding pads
    (terminal type PI, PO or PS) is on the outside of the chip.
