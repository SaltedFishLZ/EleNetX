YET ANOTHER LANGUAGE (YAL)

The examples are distributed in Yet Another Language  (YAL).   In
order  to  ease  the  burden of entering the benchmarks into your
system, we have provided a parser written in Berkeley Unix C.

The parser consists of two parts. The GetModule()  reads  from  a
specified  input  file  and provides all information contained in
next MODULE in that file. The output from GetModule is in a  sim-
ple  "generic"  form  which is easy to recognize. The WriteModule
takes as input information about a module as produced by the Get-
Module and outputs the YAL form description of the module.

Files of the parser  and  yal_parser  documentation  are  in  the
PARSER sub directory.
