  DESIGN RULES

  A.  General Comments

  Circuits which are gate arrays or totally standard  height  cells
  will  be  placed  in rows. The topology is at your discretion for
  circuits composed of  mixed  standard  cells  and  general  cells
  (building blocks).

  For gate array implementations we  will  specify  the  number  of
  rows,  placement  positions  per  row, tracks per channel and the
  number of pad positions on each side of the die.

  The gate array library includes feedthrough  positions  on  cells
  for  over-cell  routing.  At least one standard cell library will
  also permit over-cell routing.  Most cells are dual-ported.  Ter-
  minals  are  accessed  only  from  the side specified in the cell
  description. Any over-cell routing  is  assumed  to  go  straight
  across the cell.

  For general cells examples, blocks can not be "over-cell  routed"
  and also none of these examples have blocks with feed throughs.

  Two layers are available for routing.

  Some of the circuits will have a pre-specified pad placement. For
  other  circuits, pads at the bounding frame are specified only in
  terms of side and ordering, i.e., their exact positions are  ini-
  tially unknown.

  B.  Geometrical Rules

  We assume 2 layers of  interconnect  with  the  following  design
  rules:

    i.   signal wires in layer_1 have width w1;
    ii.  wire_to_wire spacing in layer_1 is s1;
    iii. signal wires in layer_2 have width w2;
    iv.  wire_to_wire spacing in layer_2 is s2;
    v.   via size is svia;
    vi.  via surrounding is vsur.

              An example is shown in the figure below.

                            svia
                            !  !
                         _________       _________
                         I       I       I       I
           --------------I  ---- I<----->I       I
                w1       I  I  I I max   I       I
           --------------I  ---- I(s1,s2)I       I
                         I_______I       I_______I
                            I  I            I  I
                            Iw2I            I  I
                            I  I            I  I

  C.  Power and Ground Nets (P/G)

  A net specified as P/G must fulfill additional constraints. These
  are  related  to electromigration phenomenon and to voltage drops
  between supplying and demanding pads. In  order  to  calculate  a
  correct  wire  width for P/G, each pin of such a net has, besides
  the usual information, two additional numbers. One is a value  of
  current drawn by the pin, the other is the maximum allowable vol-
  tage drop from pin to the supplying pad.  For supplying pad,  the
  current value specifies the maximum current which can be supplied
  by it, voltage drop is ignored.

  We  assume  the  following  relationships  for  calculating  wire
  widths:

   wire_conductance = g_const*wire_width/wire_length ;
   wire_current <= k_electro*wire_width ;
   wire_current = g_const*v_electro*wire_width/wire_length ;
   v_electro <= k_electro * wire_length / g_const ;
   g_const and k_electro will be supplied for the examples.

  Note that some power nets may have multiple pads at the boundary.
  Power nets can use all of them, some, or just one.

  D.  Critical Nets

  A group of nets  considered  critical  will  have  their  maximum
  lengths  specified.   This  means  that in the final result their
  lengths should not exceed the prespecified values.

  E.  Aspect Ratio

  The chip may have an aspect ratio specified. It should be  under-
  stood  that we are looking for the least area realization fulfil-
  ling all the requirements and bounded by a rectangle having  that
  aspect ratio.

  F.  Fixed Length or Width of Bounding Rectangle

  Instead of specifying the aspect ratio, we may request  that  one
  side of the parent block not exceed a given length.

  G. Constraints Specifications

  NOTE  that  not  all  of  the  examples   will   have   all   the
  constraints/requirements  specified.  See "Benchmark characteris-
  tics" for details.
