 GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING RESULTS

 A.  Placement and Routing Procedures

 We realize that it is difficult to fulfill all  the  requirements
 specified  for  the  examples,  especially  if  you are currently
 developing your system.  Thus we propose several levels of parti-
 cipation:

 level_1 : ( For building blocks and standard cells ) :
           Place the blocks and route all nets such that your 
           layout fits into the least area rectangle. 
           Treat P/G as signal nets.

           ( For gate arrays ) :
           Place the cells and route as many connections as you can. 
           Treat P/G nets as signal nets.

 level_2 : level_1 but P/G nets have proper wire widths such 
           that electro- migration constraints are fulfilled and, 
           if possible voltage drops as well.

 level_3 : level_1 + nets designated as critical satisfy their 
           constraints.

 level_4 : level_2 + nets designated as critical satisfy their 
           constraints.

 From now on all levels of participation  are  relevant  only  for
 building blocks and standard cell examples.

 level_5 : level_1 + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

 level_6 : level_2 + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

 level_7 : level_3 + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

 level_8 : level_4 + the bounding rectangle has a given aspect ratio.

 level_9 : level_1 + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

 level_10 : level_2 + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

 level_11 : level_3 + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

 level_12 : level_4 + the bounding rectangle has one dimension fixed.

 B.  Presentation at the Workshop

 Participants will spend a few minutes presenting their results at
 the  Workshop. This should include an overview of their placement
 and routing methods. Also, we ask you to show  us  a  picture  of
 your result for those levels to which you choose to respond. Pic-
 tures have to be drawn in a SCALE SUPPLIED BY US in the Benchmark
 Characteristics table.  Scale is a coefficient of magnification.

 C.  Quality Criteria

 For standard cells and building blocks : area  size  in  square
 microns ; for gate arrays : number of unconnected from-tos.

  Summation of total wire lengths on each layer in microns;
  Lengths of critical nets in microns;
  Total number of vias.
  Area occupied by P/G in square microns.

 We are also interested in how you routed P/G nets, what were your
 considerations  for  choosing  the  topology and determining wire
 widths.  For standard cells and building blocks examples,  please
 show  us  also  the results of placement, before routing has been
 completed.  All other comments and suggestions are welcomed.
