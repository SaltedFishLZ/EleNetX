  Dear Colleague:

  Here are the benchmark examples for  placement  and  routing  tools
  that will be discussed during the forthcoming workshop on placement
  and routing.

  At the Physical Design Workshop on Placement and Floorplanning, ex-
  amples  were  available  for  gate array and standard cell designs.
  This year we added examples for building block style layouts.   Do-
  cumentation  describing  the benchmarks is appended to this letter.
  The documentation also suggests guidelines for  presenting  results
  based on a consensus of the committee members.

  Please respond with  any  comments  or  suggestions  regarding  the
  benchmarks or documentation to the following address:

  Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska

  University of California,

  The benchmark data can be obtained from MCNC in two ways.

  If you have access to an Arpanet connection you  may  establish  an
  FTP connection to host "mcnc.mcnc.org" and copy the files using the
  mget command.  The login name is "anonymous" and  the  password  is
  "guest".   The  files  are  in  the "/pub/prworkshop/pr_bench_v2.0"
  directory.

  Check the FTP man page  for  details  (assuming  you  have  a  UNIX
  machine).   The  command sequence to get all of the benchmarks (as-
  suming that you have set the default directory to  where  you  want
  the benchmarks) is:

           ftp mcnc.mcnc.org
           anonymous     (in response to the "Name" prompt)
           guest                 (in response to the "password" prompt)
           cd pub/prworkshop/pr_bench_v2.0/DATA
           mget *
           cd ../DOCUMENTATION
           mget *
           cd ../PARSER
           mget *
           bye

  We are prepared to send you a 9-track tape in either TAR format  or
  VMS  format.  Contact the benchmark Archival Secretary (Tom Krakow)
  by phone (919 248-1959) or email  (krakow@mcnc.org)  and  tell  him
  your  requirements.  ACM SIGDA is providing funds to cover the cost
  of tapes and shipping, so there is no cost to you for this service.

  Thank you for your interest in the benchmarks.  You may  choose  to
  present  your  results  either  as a highlight of your presentation
  during any of the sessions at the workshop or during a special ses-
  sion  that  will  introduce  the benchmark posters.  If you plan to
  present a poster with benchmark results, please submit your  propo-
  sal directly to the address above no later than April 30.

  We hope to see you at the International Workshop on  Placement  and
  Routing in North Carolina this spring.

  Best regards,

  Malgorzata Marek-Sadowska
  Benchmark Chairperson
